I am currently a Research Specialist at the RISC Lab (Robotics, Intelligent Systems and Control) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia. My work focuses on developing computer vision solutions for autonomous robotics, particularly in agricultural and underwater applications.

I completed my M.S. in Electrical Engineering (graduated with Distinction) from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) in 2024, and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from LUMS in 2019. My graduate research concentrated on semi-supervised learning methods for medical image segmentation, specifically for cardiac MRI analysis.

Research Interests
======
My research interests span several areas of computer vision and machine learning:
* **Computer Vision for Robotics**: End-to-end perception pipelines for autonomous systems, real-time object detection and segmentation
* **Medical Image Analysis**: Semi-supervised and self-supervised learning for medical imaging, 3D MRI segmentation
* **Agricultural Robotics**: Perception systems for autonomous harvesting and crop monitoring
* **Deep Learning**: Model optimization, quantization, and efficient inference on embedded systems

Current Projects
======
At KAUST's RISC Lab, I am developing perception systems for autonomous date-palm harvesting robots. This involves building complete computer vision pipelines deployed on edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin), including:
* Large-scale dataset curation and annotation using CLIP-based filtering
* Real-time instance segmentation using optimized YOLOv8 models
* Model quantization (INT8/FP16) achieving 30 FPS on embedded hardware
* Integration with ROS2 robotics frameworks

Previous Work
======
During my time as a Research Associate at LUMS's ATP Lab (2022-2025), I worked extensively on semi-supervised learning for medical imaging. I developed efficient U-Net based architectures for 3D cardiac MRI segmentation that achieved state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

I also have experience in natural language processing, having worked on cross-lingual transfer learning for Urdu text classification at UET Lahore's HPCNL, and in remote sensing applications through crop classification projects using Google Earth Engine.
