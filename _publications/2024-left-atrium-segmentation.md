This paper proposes a computationally efficient U-Net based approach with two decoders for 3D Cardiac MRI scans, achieving state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The method uses ambiguity-weighted uncertainty learning to improve segmentation quality with limited labeled data.
